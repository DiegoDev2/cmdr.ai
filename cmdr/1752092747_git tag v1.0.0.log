STDOUT:


STDERR:
fatal: Failed to resolve 'HEAD' as a valid ref.


SUGGESTION:
1. Ensure you have a valid Git repository by running `git status`.  
2. If not initialized, run `git init` to create a new Git repository.  
3. Add a commit by running `git add .` followed by `git commit -m "Initial commit"` before tagging.
