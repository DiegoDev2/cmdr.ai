SUGGESTION:
1. Verify if you have the correct permissions and that you are using the right shell (bash, zsh, etc.).
2. Check if the command you're trying to run is installed by searching for it using `which init` or `command -v init`.
3. If not installed, either install it using Homebrew or the appropriate package manager or use an alternative command.
